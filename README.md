**DESC:**

Lite Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image generation application that utilizes the REPLICATE API for stable diffusion. The app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to generate art. The app is powered by an open-source text-to-image diffusion model for image generation. The goal of the app is to provide users with a simple and accessible tool for creating high quality images for t-shirt.


**FEATURES:**

 - Interface: The app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to generate art

 - Stable diffusion: using this process to generate a high quality of images.

 - REPLICATE API **("stability-ai/stable-diffusion")**: The app integrates the REPLICATE API to help users achieve the images they want.

 - Open-source REPLICATE model: The app is powered by an open-source text-to-image diffusion model for image generation.

 - Comparison to other user interfaces: The app will be compared to other AI generator user interfaces to highlight areas for improvement.
